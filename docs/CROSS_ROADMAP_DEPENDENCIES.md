# Cross-Roadmap Dependencies Summary

## Purpose

This document highlights the key cross-component dependencies where work in one roadmap **blocks** or is **required by** work in another roadmap. Use this to coordinate with your colleagues on Backend and Admin work.

## Critical Blocking Dependencies

### 🚨 FND-004 (Backend) — THE BIG BLOCKER

**Task:** Draft and review the OpenAPI contract (`docs/openapi.yaml`)

**Owner:** Backend team

**Blocks:**
- **ALL Android Phase 1 tasks** (AUTH-002, CAT-002)
- **ALL Android Phase 2 tasks** (CART-002, CHECK-001, ORD-002)
- Android DOM-002, NET-002 in Phase 0
- **ALL Backend Phase 1 implementation tasks** (AUTH-001, CAT-001, CAT-003)
- **ALL Backend Phase 2 implementation tasks** (CART-001, ORD-001)
- **ALL Admin Phase 1 tasks** (AUTH-003, CAT-004)
- **ALL Admin Phase 2 tasks** (ORD-003)

**Impact:** This is the **single most critical cross-component dependency**. Until the OpenAPI contract is accepted, no API integration work can start in any component. Android can work on Phase 0 tasks that don't need the contract (FND-006, UI-002, APP-002, DATA-002), but Phase 1 and 2 are completely blocked.

**Status:** Not started

## Phase 0 Dependencies

### Android Dependencies on Other Teams

| Android Task | Requires from Backend | Requires from Project | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| DOM-002 | **FND-004** complete | - | Needs OpenAPI contract to generate models |
| NET-002 | **FND-004** complete | - | Needs OpenAPI contract to define endpoints |
| FND-006 | - | - | Can proceed independently |
| UI-002 | - | DES-001 (screen specs) | Needs design decisions |
| APP-002 | - | - | Can proceed after UI-002 |
| DATA-002 | - | - | Can proceed independently |

### Backend Dependencies on Other Teams

| Backend Task | Requires | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| FND-002 | None | Can start immediately |
| FND-004 | Product/API/DB/Security docs | Must complete before **anyone** does API work |

### Admin Dependencies on Other Teams

| Admin Task | Requires | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| FND-003 | None | Can start immediately |

## Phase 1 Dependencies

### Android Dependencies on Other Teams

| Android Task | Requires from Backend | Requires from Admin | Requires from Project | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| AUTH-002 | **FND-004** (contract) | - | **DES-001** (screens M-06—M-09, M-17) | Backend doesn't need AUTH-001 done thanks to mock strategy |
| CAT-002 | **FND-004** (contract) | - | **DES-001** (screens M-01—M-05) | Backend doesn't need CAT-001 done thanks to mock strategy |

### Backend Dependencies on Other Teams

| Backend Task | Requires from Admin | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| AUTH-001 | - | Independent |
| CAT-001 | - | Independent |
| CAT-003 | **AUTH-003** backend portion | Admin auth must work for admin catalog to authorize |

### Admin Dependencies on Other Teams

| Admin Task | Requires from Backend | Requires from Project | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| AUTH-003 | **FND-002**, **FND-004** | **FND-005**, **DES-001** | Backend must provide Sanctum auth endpoints |
| CAT-004 | **CAT-003** | **DES-001** | Backend admin catalog API must exist |

**⚠️ AUTH-003 is SHARED:** This task has both a backend component (admin auth API endpoints, role middleware) and an admin component (React login UI, session handling). Backend colleague implements the API portion, Admin colleague implements the UI portion.

## Phase 2 Dependencies

### Android Dependencies on Other Teams

| Android Task | Requires from Backend | Requires from Project | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| CART-002 | **FND-004** (contract) | **DES-001** (screen M-10) | Backend doesn't need CART-001 done |
| CHECK-001 | **FND-004** (contract) | **DES-001** (screens M-11—M-14) | Backend doesn't need ORD-001 done |
| ORD-002 | **FND-004** (contract) | **DES-001** (screens M-15—M-16) | Backend doesn't need ORD-001 done |

### Backend Dependencies on Other Teams

| Backend Task | Requires | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| CART-001 | AUTH-001, CAT-001 | Both must be complete |
| ORD-001 | AUTH-001, CAT-001, CART-001 | All three must be complete |

### Admin Dependencies on Other Teams

| Admin Task | Requires from Backend | Requires from Project | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| ORD-003 | **ORD-001** | **DES-001** | Backend order API must exist |

## Coordination Rules

### For Android Developer (You)

1. **Phase 0:** You can work on FND-006, UI-002, APP-002, DATA-002 independently.
2. **Wait for Backend FND-004** before starting DOM-002 or NET-002.
3. **Wait for Backend FND-004 + Project DES-001** before starting any Phase 1 or Phase 2 tasks.
4. **You do NOT need to wait** for Backend AUTH-001, CAT-001, CART-001, or ORD-001 to be complete — the mock server strategy allows you to proceed with fixtures.
5. **Integration testing** (QUAL-001) is when you'll finally test against the real backend.

### For Backend Developer (Your Colleague)

1. **Phase 0:** Start FND-002 immediately. Complete FND-004 ASAP — it blocks everyone.
2. **Phase 1:** After FND-004, implement AUTH-001 and CAT-001. Then coordinate with Admin dev on AUTH-003 backend portion before doing CAT-003.
3. **Phase 2:** Complete CART-001, then ORD-001. These unlock Admin ORD-003.

### For Admin Developer (Your Colleague)

1. **Phase 0:** Start FND-003 immediately.
2. **Phase 1:** Wait for Backend FND-002, FND-004, and coordinate on AUTH-003 backend portion. Then wait for Backend CAT-003 before doing CAT-004.
3. **Phase 2:** Wait for Backend ORD-001 before starting ORD-003.

## Open Decisions That Affect Android

These decisions are listed in Android roadmap but may need input from Backend/Admin:

| ID | Question | Who Decides | Blocks |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|
| OPEN-1 to OPEN-4 | Contract decisions in openapi.yaml | Backend + Product Owner | FND-004 acceptance |
| OPEN-5 | Local mock server runner | Android + Backend | NET-002 |
| OPEN-6 | Token storage mechanism | Android | DATA-002 |
| OPEN-7 | Supporting-text token value | Android + Design | UI-002 |
| OPEN-8 | Lato weight for "600" | Android + Design | UI-002 |
| OPEN-9 | allowBackup for demo app | Android + Security | DATA-002 |
| OPEN-10 | Room deferred? | Android + Product Owner | DATA-002 |
| OPEN-11 | Lato font files placement | Android | UI-002 start |

## Task Assignment Pattern

### What You (Android Developer) Should Focus On

**Right now (Phase 0):**
- ✅ FND-001 (already complete)
- 🔨 FND-006 — Toolchain modernization (can start immediately)
- 🔨 UI-002 — Design tokens (can start after FND-006, needs DES-001 and design decisions)
- 🔨 APP-002 — App shell (can start after FND-006 + UI-002)
- 🔨 DATA-002 — Token storage (can start after FND-006, needs decisions)
- ⏸️ DOM-002 — Wait for Backend FND-004
- ⏸️ NET-002 — Wait for Backend FND-004 + DOM-002 + DATA-002

**Phase 1:**
- ⏸️ Wait for Backend FND-004 + Project DES-001
- Then: AUTH-002 and CAT-002 can run in parallel

**Phase 2:**
- ⏸️ Wait for Phase 1 Android complete
- Then: CART-002, CHECK-001, ORD-002 can run in parallel

### What Backend Colleague Should Focus On

**Right now (Phase 0):**

**Phase 2:**
- 🔨 CART-001 (after Phase 1 backend complete)
- 🔨 ORD-001 (after CART-001)

### What Admin Colleague Should Focus On

**Right now (Phase 0):**
- 🔨 FND-003 — React initialization (start immediately)

**Phase 1:**
