# Backend Roadmap

## Purpose and authority

Plan PHP/Laravel REST API and MySQL work, including contract-first implementation and isolated database checks.

This file is the canonical task list for its component. Each task appears once here; stable Task IDs identify work across branches and PRs. Project-wide phase gates and cross-component tasks are canonical in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Follow [repository-wide agent instructions](../AGENTS.md), component guidance, authoritative documents linked by the task, and the actual implementation.

A roadmap assignment must include this roadmap name, phase, and step, for example: Backend Roadmap, Phase 1, Step 1; include a Sub-step only when the canonical task explicitly defines one. Step numbers restart at 1 in every phase, and Sub-step numbering restarts within its parent Step. Nested acceptance checklists remain criteria, not separate assignments. Check dependencies before starting; a later step is not ready until its listed dependencies are complete. See [the project roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the Sub-step rule and [repository Git naming conventions](../AGENTS.md).

## Phase steps

## Phase 0 — Foundation

**Project phase gate:** see [Phase 0 in the Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

### Step 1 — FND-002 — Initialize Laravel API and local database workflow

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** none

**Scope:** create the backend application foundation using the accepted Laravel/PHP/MySQL stack, without implementing product endpoints.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Select supported stable framework/runtime versions and commit the dependency lockfile; document the selected versions.
- [ ] Provide safe local configuration instructions and `.env.example` placeholders; no real secrets are checked in.
- [ ] Configure migrations and a disposable isolated test database workflow; document how a developer creates and resets local data safely.
- [ ] Configure the backend unit/feature test runner and a minimal passing baseline test.
- [ ] Record and verify exact install, setup, migration, style/static-check, and test commands in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- [ ] Do not add business endpoints before FND-004 is reviewed.

**Verification:** clean dependency install, disposable-database migration, and backend baseline test/checks.

### Step 2 — FND-004 — Draft and review the OpenAPI contract

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** none; must finish before any endpoint or client integration Task

**Scope:** create `docs/openapi.yaml` from the accepted product/API/database/security decisions and close the remaining contract decisions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Describe registration, login/logout, profile, and password-reset flows; public category/product listing, search, sorting, pagination, and product details; customer cart; order creation, history/detail, and simulated payment result; admin authentication, catalog/category/inventory management, and order-status management.
- [ ] Define request/response schemas, required/optional fields, validation constraints, status codes, shared error envelope, pagination, USD money representation, and representative examples.
- [ ] Define Android bearer-token and admin Sanctum session/CSRF security schemes, ownership/role expectations, and rate-limit classes/limits.
- [ ] Define order idempotency behavior, price/stock authority, order/address snapshots, and simulated payment success/failure state semantics consistently with `PRODUCT.md` and `DATABASE.md`.
- [ ] Resolve category lifecycle and product reassignment behavior: the roadmap mentions category archive, while the current logical category schema has no status field.
- [ ] Validate the document with a documented OpenAPI validator and record the exact validation command; resolve all errors.
- [ ] Obtain API-owner review/acceptance and update `API_CONTRACT.md` to link to the approved machine-readable contract without duplicating endpoint schemas.

**Verification:** OpenAPI validation plus a human review against the referenced product, architecture, database, and security documents. Endpoint implementation remains blocked until acceptance.

## Phase 1 — Accounts and Catalog

**Project phase gate:** see [Phase 1 in the Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

### Step 1 — AUTH-001 — Customer account API

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-002, FND-004, FND-005

**Scope:** customer registration, login/logout, profile, password reset, secure password storage, rate limiting/lockout controls, and revocable Android Sanctum tokens.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Valid registration/login/profile/logout/reset flows match the reviewed OpenAPI schemas and security rules.
- [ ] Invalid input, duplicate email, invalid credentials, reset-token failure/expiry, rate limits, and logout revocation return documented outcomes without leaking secrets.
- [ ] Tests prove passwords are hashed, token lifetime/revocation rules and account lockout after repeated failures are enforced, and reset email can be safely exercised through a local mail sink.
- [ ] Tests cover relevant validation, authentication, and abuse boundaries; no real email or external provider is required for local tests.

**Verification:** backend unit and API feature/security tests for every listed success and failure path.

### Step 2 — CAT-001 — Catalog read API and fictional seed data

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-002, FND-004, FND-005

**Scope:** category/product schema, fictional seed catalog, and public read/search/sort/pagination endpoints.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Migrations enforce documented relationships, valid prices, product status, and image ordering; use fixed-precision USD money.
- [ ] Seed/reset creates useful fictional categories/products/images reproducibly and never contains real personal data.
- [ ] Listing, detail, category, search, sort, pagination, and empty-result behavior match OpenAPI.
- [ ] Invalid filters and pagination boundaries return documented errors; inactive/unavailable products do not leak into customer results.

**Verification:** migration/seed checks and API feature tests for results, filters, pagination, validation, and public access.

### Step 3 — CAT-003 — Admin catalog and inventory API

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-002, FND-004, AUTH-003, CAT-001

**Scope:** admin-only create/read/update/archive operations for products and categories, plus validated inventory updates.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] CRUD and inventory operations follow OpenAPI, validation, and database constraints.
- [ ] Guest/customer access is rejected; tests cover role enforcement, invalid values, missing resources, and inventory boundaries.
- [ ] Public catalog changes reflect persisted admin updates; deleted/archived data follows the documented status behavior.
- [ ] No client-supplied total or stock value bypasses server-side validation.

**Verification:** backend feature tests with database state assertions and authorization tests for each protected operation.

## Phase 2 — Cart, Checkout, and Orders

**Project phase gate:** see [Phase 2 in the Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

### Step 1 — CART-001 — Customer cart API

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-002, FND-004, AUTH-001, CAT-001

**Scope:** one persistent cart per signed-in customer with add/update/remove/read operations.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Server validates product availability, positive bounded quantity, and current product/stock state on every mutation.
- [ ] Cart totals use server-side fixed-precision money; clients cannot set authoritative prices.
- [ ] Customer ownership is enforced on every read and mutation; tests try another customer's cart identifiers.
- [ ] Empty cart, unavailable product, stock conflict, invalid quantity, and normal edits return the documented outcomes.

**Verification:** database-backed API tests for all mutations, totals, errors, and cross-customer authorization.

### Step 2 — ORD-001 — Order creation and simulated payment API

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-002, FND-004, AUTH-001, CAT-001, CART-001

**Scope:** server-authoritative checkout quote/order creation, address and line-item snapshots, idempotency, and explicitly simulated success/failure payment outcomes.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Server recalculates prices, subtotal, configured sample shipping, and total using fixed precision; it ignores client totals.
- [ ] Order stores immutable product/address/price snapshots and follows documented state transitions.
- [ ] Order creation and payment/stock transitions are transaction-safe under concurrent or stale-stock requests; match `DATABASE.md` by changing inventory transactionally only when simulated payment succeeds.
- [ ] Repeating the same idempotency key/request does not create duplicate orders; conflicting reuse returns a documented result.
- [ ] Simulation accepts no card data, calls no real provider, and clearly distinguishes success from failure; failed payment is never shown as paid.
- [ ] Tests cover duplicate submission, stale stock, insufficient stock, transaction rollback, totals, ownership, and both payment outcomes.

**Verification:** database-backed API/transaction tests, idempotency tests, and security/ownership tests.
