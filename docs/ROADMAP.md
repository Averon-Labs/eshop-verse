# Project Roadmap and Shared Task Backlog

## Purpose and source of truth

This is the project-level index for phase gates, cross-component tasks, and Task ID ownership. It is not the task list for Android, backend, or admin implementation. Assign component work from [ANDROID_ROADMAP.md](ANDROID_ROADMAP.md), [BACKEND_ROADMAP.md](BACKEND_ROADMAP.md), or [ADMIN_ROADMAP.md](ADMIN_ROADMAP.md); those files hold canonical task scope, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification expectations.

Each component roadmap resets step numbering to Step 1 at the start of every phase. Assign work by the roadmap name, phase, and step, or by the stable Task ID. If the component is not identified, ask which roadmap. Cross-component work is listed here and referenced by component roadmaps without copying its acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria use lowercase letter labels that restart at `a` in each criteria block; these labels identify criteria for discussion and verification, not separate work assignments.

### Steps and acceptance criteria

The numbered Step is the roadmap unit and has one canonical Task ID. Assign an agent by Task ID or roadmap/phase/step. Each acceptance criterion is labeled with a lowercase English letter, restarting at `a` for every criteria block. Use the label to refer to a requirement (for example, “criterion b”); it does not define a separate assignment. Work that needs its own lifecycle or dependency graph must have a separate Task ID.

Each Task gets one branch and PR; all specialist stages for that Task use the same branch. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the branch and commit naming format.

Product boundaries are in [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md), architecture choices in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [decisions/](decisions/), shared UI rules in [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) and [SCREEN_SPECIFICATIONS.md](SCREEN_SPECIFICATIONS.md), API conventions in [API_CONTRACT.md](API_CONTRACT.md), and test/security rules in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Those documents define standards; the canonical roadmap task entry tracks implementation.

Do not create a separate .ai/tasks/<TASK-ID>.md or .ai/plans/<TASK-ID>.md for ordinary work. Use those files only for substantial persistent context that cannot fit the canonical task; link them from that task and do not duplicate acceptance criteria.

## Project goal

Deliver a polished, end-to-end, single-store shopping demo for an international portfolio audience: an English-only Android customer app in Java/XML, a Laravel/MySQL REST API, and a React/TypeScript admin dashboard. Prices are sample USD amounts, data is fictional, and payment outcomes are simulated. This is not a production commerce launch.

## Branch and release model

- develop is the shared integration branch. Each assigned Task gets one short-lived branch from develop and a PR targeting develop; builder, tester, and debugger use that branch sequentially.
- Delete a task branch after its PR is accepted and merged. Keep develop permanently.
- At a phase/release boundary, complete phase exit criteria and run release checks on develop. Promote a release only through a reviewed develop-to-main PR; tag the released commit.
- The current main contains earlier merged bootstrap/documentation work and has no formal release tag. Preserve that history as the one-time pre-policy baseline; do not reset or rewrite main.
- See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for branch naming, PR, review, and cleanup rules. Markdown does not change GitHub settings; verify actual remote configuration.

## Verified starting point

Last reviewed: 2026-10-07. Recheck source and Git state before starting each Task.

- Android has a regenerated Java/XML Gradle scaffold: namespace/application ID com.averonlabs.eshopverse, compile SDK 36.1, minSdk 25, targetSdk 36, Java 11 source/target, AGP 9.2.1, Gradle 9.4.1, Material Components 1.10.0, and JUnit 4. Exact setup/build/test commands remain to be confirmed under Android FND-001.
- backend/ and admin/ contain agent guidance but no initialized applications.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml is a placeholder. Its active job checks repository structure; component checks are not active.
- GitHub develop was created from the current pre-policy main baseline. Default branch, auto-delete, and branch protection must be verified under GIT-001.
- docs/openapi.yaml does not exist. docs/API_CONTRACT.md records shared conventions, but endpoint schemas and per-class rate limits remain open.
- docs/DATABASE.md is a logical model, not implemented migrations.

This is a repository snapshot, not a promise that the state remains unchanged. Confirm facts again when a Task starts.

## Status and completion rules

- Task status: [ ] not started, [~] in progress, [x] complete with evidence, [!] blocked with the reason recorded.
- Acceptance checkboxes are checked only after implementation and verification evidence are reviewed.
- A task is complete when every criterion passes, required checks are green, and the reviewer has exact commands, outcomes, and the commit tested. Follow the Definition of Done in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
- If a task exposes a missing product or architecture decision, ask the owner and stop dependent work; do not silently broaden scope or contradict an accepted ADR.
- OpenAPI must be reviewed and accepted before implementing API endpoints or client integrations. The owner can review the draft as a concrete artifact; no additional product choice is needed to prepare it from accepted scope.

## How to assign and execute a task

Name the roadmap, phase, and step (step numbering restarts at 1 in each phase), or give the stable Task ID. `ROADMAP.md` defines project gates and shared tasks and indexes component work; `ANDROID_ROADMAP.md`, `BACKEND_ROADMAP.md`, and `ADMIN_ROADMAP.md` hold the canonical component task scopes, dependencies, letter-labeled acceptance criteria, and verification expectations. Use criterion letters to refer to requirements, not to create separate assignments. For assignment, reading, clarification, and execution rules, follow the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Phase 0 — Foundation (current)

**Exit criteria:** all three components have repeatable, verified setup and check commands; the OpenAPI contract has been reviewed before endpoint work; CI runs the agreed component checks; GitHub's integration/release branch settings match GIT-001; the shared first-release UI specification is accepted before screen implementation; remaining choices that block the first customer-to-order flow are recorded and resolved.


**Android steps:** [Android Roadmap — Phase 0](ANDROID_ROADMAP.md). **Backend steps:** [Backend Roadmap — Phase 0](BACKEND_ROADMAP.md). **Admin steps:** [Admin Roadmap — Phase 0](ADMIN_ROADMAP.md).

### Step 1 — GIT-001 — Establish the develop integration branch

**Status:** `[~]`

**Depends on:** none

**Scope:** establish the shared integration branch and align GitHub's branch workflow with the release policy without rewriting existing history.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] **a.** Create `develop` from the current `main` baseline and preserve all existing merged history; do not force-push or reset `main`.
- [ ] **b.** Set `develop` as the GitHub default branch so new task PRs default to the integration branch.
- [ ] **c.** Configure GitHub to automatically delete merged task branches; keep `develop` and `main`.
- [ ] **d.** Protect `develop` and `main` from direct/force pushes and require PR review. Review `develop` → `main` as a release PR only.
- [ ] **e.** Open/re-target current in-flight work as a PR into `develop`; do not merge it automatically.

**Verification:** inspect live GitHub branch refs, default branch, PR base, deletion setting, and protection rules. Confirm `main` was not rewritten.

### Step 2 — DES-001 — Define shared visual direction and first-release screen specifications

**Status:** `[x]`

**Depends on:** none

**Scope:** translate the owner's supplied visual reference into one shared Android/admin visual language and document first-release screens already required by the product and roadmap. The reference is style guidance only; it must not expand page, content, or behavior scope.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] **a.** `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` defines the cross-platform coral/neutral palette, Lato typography, shared spacing/shapes/elevation, Android Material 3 rules, web dashboard patterns, responsive behavior, and accessibility requirements.
- [x] **b.** `docs/SCREEN_SPECIFICATIONS.md` describes all first-release Android and admin screens, navigation shells, primary content/actions, and relevant loading/empty/error/success behavior.
- [x] **c.** Screen specifications apply reference layout cues only where an existing screen has a matching role; other screens retain their product/roadmap content hierarchy and flow while using shared visual tokens.
- [x] **d.** Screen flows respect the product/database/API boundaries: authenticated cart, sample shipping and no tax, simulated payment without card data, seeded product images, and admin-only catalog/inventory/order capabilities.
- [x] **e.** Out-of-scope reference concepts are excluded; unresolved data/API conflicts (including category archive behavior) are explicitly recorded rather than invented.
- [x] **f.** Android/web agent guidance, product/roadmap references, and ADR index link to the shared design documents without duplicating the page inventory.

**Verification:** documentation review against `PRODUCT.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `API_CONTRACT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and existing Android/admin Tasks; check internal links and `git diff --check`. No code or runtime test is applicable.

### Step 3 — PLAN-001 — Split component roadmaps and define task execution and clarification workflow

**Status:** `[x]`

**Depends on:** none

**Scope:** organize the canonical backlog into component roadmaps with phase-local step numbers and make task assignment, clarification, and sequential agent execution unambiguous.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] **a.** Create separate Android, Backend, and Admin roadmaps; every phase numbers its steps from Step 1.
- [x] **b.** Keep each Task ID's scope, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification expectations in exactly one canonical entry; link shared work rather than copying it.
- [x] **c.** Update repository and component instructions and developer-facing entry points to tell agents which roadmap to read and how a step assignment maps to a Task ID.
- [x] **d.** Define when to proceed without a question, when a material ambiguity requires an owner question, and that work continues after the answer without a second confirmation.
- [x] **e.** Define the end-to-end sequential build, independent test, conditional debug, retest, review, and PR-ready workflow.
- [x] **f.** Verify roadmap task mapping, step numbering, internal links, and the documentation diff.

**Verification:** inspect the generated roadmaps and all updated references; run documentation link/Task ID consistency checks and git diff --check. Application build and runtime tests are not applicable.

### Step 4 — FND-005 — Make setup documentation and CI match the real projects

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-001, FND-002, FND-003, FND-004, GIT-001

**Scope:** replace placeholder-only project checks with repeatable component checks and document what CI actually enforces.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] **a.** `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` contains copyable setup/build/lint/static-check/test commands for Android, backend, admin, and OpenAPI validation; each command is verified against the checked-in tooling.
- [ ] **b.** Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run the documented required checks for each initialized component on task PRs to `develop` and release PRs to `main`, using isolated test data and no committed secrets.
- [ ] **c.** Preserve failures as failures: do not skip, disable, or mask a required check to make CI green.
- [ ] **d.** Verify the workflow on a pull request or equivalent run and record its result. Inspect repository default-branch, auto-delete, and branch-protection settings against GIT-001; configure required status checks only after verifying their names, and document any setting that is not enforced.
- [ ] **e.** Remove stale “not initialized” comments/status once they are false; never claim a workflow or branch rule is active without evidence.

**Verification:** run the exact documented commands locally or in CI; inspect a successful workflow run and separately report any external branch-protection setting that remains unenforced.

### Step 5 — PLAN-002 — Separate agent role workflows and remove duplicated process guidance

**Status:** `[x]`

**Depends on:** PLAN-001

**Scope:** keep shared repository policy in the root instructions, put actionable build, test, and debug procedures in role-specific workflow guides, and remove repeated process descriptions from supporting Markdown without merging distinct product or technical references.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] **a.** Add concise build, independent-test, and conditional-debug workflow guides under `.agents/workflows/`; each defines its entry conditions, scope boundaries, required evidence, and handoff to the next stage.
- [x] **b.** Keep `AGENTS.md` as the shared entry point and route each specialist to the correct guide; preserve the sequential same-task-branch flow, distinct builder/tester/debugger roles, independent retest, and no-repeat-without-new-evidence rule.
- [x] **c.** Use a focused local commit as each editing stage's handoff snapshot: builder commits implementation, tester commits any test-only additions, and debugger commits a fix; report the exact SHA verified and do not push during normal stage transitions.
- [x] **d.** Keep `docs/TESTING.md` focused on test strategy and test conventions; keep component setup details in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and component-specific agent instructions in each component `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] **e.** Remove duplicated agent-stage procedures from supporting documents while preserving unique component, test-design, setup, contribution, and handoff requirements.
- [x] **f.** Update documentation entry points and links; confirm each roadmap Task ID remains canonical in one entry and verify Markdown links and the final documentation diff.

**Verification:** review the shared and role-specific instructions for conflicts, check all changed internal Markdown links and roadmap references, and run `git diff --check`. Application builds and runtime tests are not applicable to this documentation-only task.

### Step 6 — PLAN-003 — Define assignable sub-steps and component-aware Git naming (superseded)

**Status:** `[x]`

**Historical note:** Superseded by PLAN-004. The Sub-step assignment model below is retained only as the record of the earlier approach; it is no longer active guidance. Component-aware branch and commit naming remains in effect, with the format defined by current `AGENTS.md`.

**Depends on:** PLAN-001, PLAN-002

**Scope:** distinguish acceptance criteria from independently assignable roadmap sub-steps and standardize branch and commit names so they identify component, phase, step, optional sub-step, and Task ID.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] **a.** Define when a nested roadmap item remains an acceptance criterion and when it merits a numbered, independently assignable sub-step; preserve current nested acceptance checklists unless they meet that rule.
- [x] **b.** Define phase-local step and optional sub-step numbering consistently across the project and component roadmaps.
- [x] **c.** Update repository Git guidance with a consistent branch and Conventional Commit format identifying component, phase, step, optional sub-step, and Task ID.
- [x] **d.** Keep branch type aligned with work (`feature`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.) and define how an independently assigned sub-step maps to scope, branch, PR, and parent Task completion.
- [x] **e.** Verify roadmap hierarchy, examples, internal links, naming consistency, and `git diff --check`; no application build or runtime test applies.

**Verification:** independently reviewed the updated instructions and roadmap examples at commit `e6dd539b9fbfd1a0fad9637ab986084efe51b7ba`; Markdown relative-link, roadmap hierarchy/naming consistency, and `git diff --check` checks passed. Application builds and runtime tests are not applicable to this documentation-only task.

### Step 8 — PLAN-004 — Label roadmap acceptance criteria and remove Sub-step assignment rules

**Status:** `[~]`

**Depends on:** PLAN-003, CI-001

**Scope:** make every roadmap acceptance criterion addressable by a lowercase English letter within its Task, remove Sub-step as an assignment or branch-naming concept, and retain Phase/Step/Task as the roadmap hierarchy.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] **a.** Label every acceptance criterion in the project and component roadmaps `a`, `b`, `c`, and so on; restart at `a` for each Task's acceptance-criteria section.
- [x] **b.** Update shared instructions and roadmap introductions so assignments can reference Task criteria by their letters without introducing Sub-steps.
- [x] **c.** Remove optional Sub-step coordinates from branch and Conventional Commit formats; retain component, phase, step, Task ID, and change type.
- [x] **d.** Mark PLAN-003's Sub-step approach as superseded while preserving its historical record and the component-aware naming guidance that remains valid.
- [ ] **e.** Verify labels restart correctly for every acceptance-criteria block, no active Sub-step rules remain, roadmap/task references and Markdown links are valid, and `git diff --check` passes.

**Verification:** independently inspect all roadmap acceptance criteria and assignment/Git rules; run a Markdown link and criterion-label consistency check plus `git diff --check`. No application build or runtime test applies.

## Phase 1 — Accounts and Catalog

**Entry criteria:** Phase 0 exit criteria are met, including acceptance of DES-001 before implementing customer/admin screens. Implement the shared contract; update and review OpenAPI before changing endpoint behavior.


Task steps are component-specific: see [Android](ANDROID_ROADMAP.md), [Backend](BACKEND_ROADMAP.md), and [Admin](ADMIN_ROADMAP.md).

**Phase 1 exit criteria:** a customer can register/sign in and browse/search seeded products; the admin can sign in and manage the catalog/inventory; server-side authorization, API/UI failure states, and the listed component tests pass.


## Phase 2 — Cart, Checkout, and Orders

**Entry criteria:** Phase 1 exit criteria are met. All money, stock, ownership, idempotency, and state transitions follow the reviewed contract.


Task steps are component-specific: see [Android](ANDROID_ROADMAP.md), [Backend](BACKEND_ROADMAP.md), and [Admin](ADMIN_ROADMAP.md).

**Phase 2 exit criteria:** a signed-in customer can complete the sample purchase flow through the API and database, including explicit simulated success/failure and safe duplicate submission; the customer can view the order and an admin can manage its status. Required ownership, stock, payment-state, and regression checks pass.


## Phase 3 — Quality and Portfolio Delivery

**Entry criteria:** Phase 2 customer purchase flow and admin order workflow are complete.


### Step 1 — QUAL-001 — Cross-component purchase-flow regression

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** AUTH-002, CAT-002, CART-002, CHECK-001, ORD-002

**Scope:** a small number of deterministic end-to-end/smoke checks across Android, API, and database for the core customer journey.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] **a.** A clean seeded customer can browse, add/update cart items, complete simulated success, and view the resulting order.
- [ ] **b.** Simulated failure, duplicate submission, and at least one authorization boundary are covered by automated integration/regression checks at the most appropriate layer.
- [ ] **c.** Tests use isolated disposable data and cannot charge/contact a real provider.
- [ ] **d.** The suite runs locally and in CI with documented commands and actionable failure output.

**Verification:** run the smoke/regression suite from a clean database state and verify its CI job.

### Step 2 — QUAL-002 — Accessibility and UI quality pass

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** DES-001, CAT-002, CAT-004, CART-002, CHECK-001, ORD-002, ORD-003

**Scope:** inspect and fix first-release accessibility, responsive behavior, consistency, and user-facing state gaps.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] **a.** Critical Android and admin flows have labels, focus/keyboard behavior, readable contrast/text, and usable narrow-screen layouts.
- [ ] **b.** Screens consistently handle loading, empty, error, success, and retry states without dead ends.
- [ ] **c.** Findings are recorded with a reproducible check or screenshot where useful; no unrelated redesign is introduced.

**Verification:** repeatable manual checklist plus focused automated accessibility/UI checks where supported by existing tooling.

### Step 3 — QUAL-003 — Security and privacy review

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** AUTH-001, AUTH-003, CAT-003, CART-001, ORD-001, ORD-003

**Scope:** verify implemented first-release controls against [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and the relevant OWASP API risks.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] **a.** Review object/function-level authorization, authentication, input validation, rate limiting, CSRF/CORS, secret handling, logging, and dependency advisories.
- [ ] **b.** Record each finding with severity, evidence, and resolution or an explicitly accepted non-production limitation; fix in-scope high-risk findings before release.
- [ ] **c.** Regression tests cover every fixed authorization/security defect; no secrets or real personal/payment data exist in repository history or demo seeds.
- [ ] **d.** The demo notice accurately states simulated payment and non-production limits.

**Verification:** security test matrix, dependency audit commands from `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, and reviewed findings record.

### Step 4 — QUAL-004 — Demo data and portfolio handoff guide

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-002, FND-003, CAT-001, AUTH-003, ORD-001

**Scope:** make local evaluation understandable and reproducible for a portfolio reviewer.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] **a.** Document clean setup, migrations/seeding, running all components, available demo roles, and reset procedure.
- [ ] **b.** Demo credentials are generated or local-only and clearly marked; no reusable public secrets or real user data are committed.
- [ ] **c.** Include concise architecture/flow explanation, screenshots or a short visual walkthrough, and known limitations.
- [ ] **d.** Explain that payment is simulated and no production readiness is claimed.

**Verification:** a person unfamiliar with the repository follows the guide from a clean checkout without undocumented steps.

### Step 5 — QUAL-005 — Clean-checkout release rehearsal

**Status:** `[ ]`

**Depends on:** FND-005, QUAL-001, QUAL-002, QUAL-003, QUAL-004

**Scope:** final local/CI rehearsal and closeout for the non-deployed portfolio release.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] **a.** From a clean checkout, install/setup instructions work and all documented required builds, static checks, tests, OpenAPI validation, and CI checks pass.
- [ ] **b.** No placeholder instructions, false CI claims, unreviewed API-contract changes, committed secrets, or unexplained known failures remain.
- [ ] **c.** Record tested commit, exact commands, results, limitations, and any follow-up task IDs.
- [ ] **d.** The phase exit criteria are reviewed; mark the roadmap tasks complete only with evidence.

**Verification:** independent reviewer repeats the documented clean-checkout procedure and checks the CI run and final task evidence.

**Component evidence:** the three component roadmaps list expected contributions to these canonical shared tasks; those are references, not extra task copies.

**Phase 3 exit criteria:** an unfamiliar reviewer can set up and evaluate the complete local demo from a clean checkout; required CI/security/accessibility checks pass; demo limitations and any deferred follow-up work are clear.

## Optional follow-up — Public deployment

Public hosting is outside the required portfolio release. Do not block Phases 0–3 on it. If requested, create a separately scoped deployment Task after the local release is complete. Before execution, the owner must choose/approve the hosting provider, domain/origin arrangement, budget, secrets/configuration, and public demo-account policy. Deployment must use HTTPS, fictional data, and the simulated-payment boundary; production operations remain a separate project.

## Deferred product features

Wishlist, reviews, push notifications, coupons, analytics, guest checkout, multiple currencies/languages, real payment processing, taxes, carrier integrations, multi-vendor support, and production operations are not required for this release. Add any only through an explicitly accepted scope/ADR and a new Task ID in the appropriate canonical roadmap.
