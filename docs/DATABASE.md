# Database Design

## Overview

The platform uses **MySQL** as its primary relational database. This document describes the first-release data model for the single-store portfolio demo.

> **Note:** This is a logical design, not a finalized physical schema. Implement schema changes as reviewed Laravel migrations. The demo uses fictional data and simulated payment only.

## Conceptual Entities

### Users

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | Auto-increment |
| email | String | Unique, required |
| password_hash | String | Hashed, never stored in plain text |
| first_name | String | Required |
| last_name | String | Required |
| role | Enum | customer, admin |
| status | Enum | active, suspended, deleted |
| created_at | Timestamp | |
| updated_at | Timestamp | |

### Products

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| name | String | Required |
| description | Text | |
| price | Decimal | Required; sample USD amount |
| sku | String | Unique, optional |
| category_id | Foreign Key | References Categories |
| status | Enum | active, inactive, archived |
| created_at | Timestamp | |
| updated_at | Timestamp | |

All first-release prices are USD, so a per-row currency column is unnecessary. Money values use fixed-precision storage and are never calculated with binary floating point. The API returns a decimal string with the `USD` currency code.

### Product Images

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| product_id | Foreign Key | References Products |
| url | String | Seeded/demo image URL |
| sort_order | Integer | Orders images for product display |

Product images are separate rows so each product can have an ordered image set. Uploading images is deferred; seeded URLs are sufficient for the demo.

### Categories

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| name | String | Required |
| sort_order | Integer | |
| created_at | Timestamp | |

Categories are flat in the first release; hierarchical categories are deferred.

### Inventory

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| product_id | Foreign Key | References Products |
| quantity | Integer | Current stock level |
| updated_at | Timestamp | |

**Relationship:** One inventory row per product, enforced by a unique `product_id`. Update stock and order state transactionally when a simulated payment succeeds.

### Cart

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| user_id | Foreign Key | References Users |
| created_at | Timestamp | |
| updated_at | Timestamp | |

### Cart Items

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| cart_id | Foreign Key | References Cart |
| product_id | Foreign Key | References Products |
| quantity | Integer | |
| added_at | Timestamp | |

There is one cart per signed-in user in the first release. A cart contains at most one row per product.

### Orders

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| user_id | Foreign Key | References Users |
| status | Enum | pending_payment, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled |
| subtotal_amount | Decimal | Sum of order item totals |
| shipping_amount | Decimal | Fixed sample shipping amount; USD |
| total_amount | Decimal | |
| shipping_address_snapshot | JSON | Required immutable copy of the address used for this order |
| notes | Text | Optional |
| created_at | Timestamp | |
| updated_at | Timestamp | |

### Order Items

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| order_id | Foreign Key | References Orders |
| product_id | Foreign Key | References Products |
| product_name | String | Product name snapshot at purchase time |
| quantity | Integer | |
| unit_price | Decimal | Price at time of order |
| total_price | Decimal | |

### Demo Payments

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | Primary Key | |
| order_id | Foreign Key | References Orders |
| amount | Decimal | |
| method | Enum | `demo` only |
| status | Enum | pending, completed, failed |
| transaction_id | String | Fictional demo reference; never a real payment credential |
| created_at | Timestamp | |

### Deferred Domains

Reviews, notifications, coupons, saved addresses, and wishlists are outside the first-release schema. Add them only with approved product requirements.

## Deferred Decisions

- Production soft-delete and audit-history requirements.
- Coupon, refund, tax, and real payment-provider models.
- Production image storage and retention.
- Production deployment, backup, and recovery requirements.

Use `utf8mb4`, indexes for foreign keys and frequently queried fields, and migrations for every schema change. Review final indexes and constraints against actual query patterns.
