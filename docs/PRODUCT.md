# Product Definition

## Purpose

EShop Verse is a portfolio project that demonstrates a complete single-store shopping flow across an Android customer app, a REST API, and an admin dashboard. It is a demonstration, not a live commerce service.

## First Release Scope

- Audience: international portfolio viewers.
- Customer-facing language: English only.
- Display locale: `en-US` for the demo's English text and USD formatting.
- Display currency: USD sample prices; no live settlement or currency conversion.
- Store model: one store, not a multi-vendor marketplace.
- Checkout: signed-in customers only, with explicitly labelled simulated success and failure scenarios. Do not collect or store real payment credentials.
- Shipping: one configured sample rate and an address snapshot on each order; no carrier integration or tax calculation.
- Seed data: fictional products, users, and orders only.

### Customer Journey

1. Browse categories and products; search and sort the catalog.
2. Open product details and manage a cart.
3. Register or sign in, provide a shipping address, and review the order total.
4. Choose a clearly labelled simulated success or failure and see the matching order result.
5. View the order and its status in order history.

### In Scope

- Android app in Java and XML using Material 3, MVVM, and repositories.
- Laravel REST API backed by MySQL.
- React and TypeScript admin dashboard that accesses backend functionality only through the API.
- Admin product, category, inventory, and order-status workflows.

### Deferred

- Real payment processing, guest checkout, multiple currencies or languages, tax calculation, and carrier integration.
- Multi-vendor support, coupons, bulk import/export, advanced analytics, reviews, wishlists, and push notifications.
- Production operations and public launch requirements. Those need a separate deployment and operations plan.
