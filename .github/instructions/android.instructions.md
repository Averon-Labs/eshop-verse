## Key Rules

- Language: Java
- UI: XML layouts with Material 3
- Architecture: MVVM + Repository Pattern
- All user-visible strings in `strings.xml`; feature screens add their own `values/strings_<feature>.xml`
- Follow naming conventions in `android/AGENTS.md`
- API communication only through `docs/openapi.yaml`, the reviewed contract
- Read only the reading set your task brief names; do not read the whole `docs/` tree
- Never edit a file owned by another task (shell, Gradle, manifest, theme/colour/dimension/style tokens, or another feature's package)
- Never parse money into a `double`; use the shared fixed-precision money type and formatter
- No new colours, dimensions, styles, or typography in a screen; report a missing token instead
